### Hi there, I'm Bauke ðŸ‘‹

I'm a deep learning practitionerðŸ§ /data scientistðŸ“ˆ. I have a background in computer science and data science, and thus both are very prevelant in my work. I have created some bots, some deep learning implementations and some libraries related to synthetic data. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting up a personal website and synthetic data using GANs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack (Deep/machine) Learning 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PyTorch and SOTA NLP or Computer Vision models! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
- ðŸ˜Š My favorite machine learning sources are [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), [Sotabench](https://sotabench.com) and [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com)

## Master Thesis

In my thesis, I researched improvements that we can make to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to apply them better to tabular data. Contrary to GANs for vision tasks, GANs for tabular data are still very early work with only some researchers working on it. Apart from two improvements to the GAN architecture, I also wrote an open source library that focuses on how to evaluate synthetic data. You can find the github repos and the thesis PDF below.
