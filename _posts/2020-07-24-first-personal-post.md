# Introduction to personal website
__Welcome!__

After fighting with setting up a custom domain, I've not officially set out to write about some interesting topics here. The main challenge for me, by length, will be to work towards rounding something of within a limited amount of time. I always get sucked into diving way too deep into a topic, to a point where I'm not knowledgeable enough anymore to understand, and then I lose interest :sweat_smile:. This time will definitely be different!


What do I want to do here? I'd like to write about interesting stuff I find online, discover or think of! Yes, very original :). What does this mean, concretely? 

I'm going to talk about:
- Deep learnig 
- Machine learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Natural language processing
- Computer Vision
- Whatever else I find interesting. I can do what I want, mom!

Current impediments for realizing my dreams:
- How do you use latex here? $\lambda$, does this work?
- Finding some good topics. 

### Thanks and hope to see you!
